Buy a bunny toy from your local toy store
=========================================

Bunnies are
[free software users](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

This was funny when I started making this example site for Untitled, but then
the novelty wore off. I wanted to make a parody of the Libreboot website.

Anyway, look at some of the pages on this site.

This gives you an idea for how to make a nice site using the Untitled static
site generator.

Anyway, go buy a bunny. Not a real bunny, because keeping rabbits locked up is
unethical, but you can buy a plushy of a bunny. From your local toy store.
