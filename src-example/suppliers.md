title: Buy a bunny
...

These sales fund bunnies
==========================

In the past, there was Toys R Us.

Alas, they no longer exist, but you can probably find a local toy store that
sells bunnies.

Bunnies need a home. They are manufactured in large number, and they all need
a loving companion!

Love your bunny
---------------

Your bunny hates being left alone. Keep it with you at all times.

Buy a bunny!
------------

Don't buy a real bunny, because keeping bunnies locked up is unethical.

Instead, buy a plushy doll in the image of a bunny, from your local toy store.
